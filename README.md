# 🔍 SQL Queries
The SQL queries are available in the 'hcahps sql code.sql' file in the project repository. 

The SQL script **cleans and standardizes** the HCAHPS patient survey data by converting mixed data types into consistent numeric values. It extracts **nationwide patient satisfaction trends** using SQL joins and unions. Views are created to compare **Top Box Ratings** between **2013 and 2022** for each state. A final view calculates the **improvement in patient satisfaction** over time. The cleaned data is ready for **Power BI visualization**. 🚀
